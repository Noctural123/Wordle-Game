# Wordle-Game
- Wordle is a game that has blown up in the past year that tests one's vocabulary skills.
- Took about 3.5 hours to make in Java.
- Made through Eclipse IDE.

## HOW TO PLAY

The game has a hidden word that the user is trying to guess. This is the 249th word that Wordle has released. 
The hidden word has 5 letters, as all Wordle words do.  
• The user’s first guess had the correct letter in the last position, and the letters in the 2nd 
and 4th positions were in the word, but not in the correct position.  
• The user’s second guess and the correct letters in the first and last positions, and the 
letters in the 2nd and 3rd positions were in the word but not the correct position.  
• The third guess and 4 of the 5 letters correct and in the correct positions.  
• The fourth guess was correct.  This means that my friend got the word correct in 4/6 
guesses.
